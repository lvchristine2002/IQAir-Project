        <h3>Air quality index is a scale used to communicate the quality of air and its potential health effects based on the concentration
            of various air pollutants, including ground-level ozone, particulate matter, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen dioxide.

        <h2>Air Quality Index Levels: </h2>
        <p><strong>AQI 0-50:</strong> Good</p>
        <p><strong>Air Quality:</strong> Satisfactory, and air pollution poses little or no risk.</p>
        <p><strong>Health Effects:</strong> None expected for the general population</p>
        <br>
        <p><strong>AQI 51-100:</strong> Moderate</p>
        <p><strong>Air Quality:</strong> Acceptable; however, there may be a concern for some pollutants for a very small number
        of individuals who are unusually sensitive to air pollution.</p>
        <p><strong>Health Effects:</strong> No significant impact on health for the majority of the population.</p>
        <br>
        <p><strong>AQI 101-150:</strong> Unhealthy for sensitive groups</p>
        <p><strong>Air Quality:</strong> Air quality may be a concern for people with respiratory or heart conditions, children, 
        and older adults.</p>
        <p><strong>Health Effects:</strong> Members of sensitive groups may experience health effects, but the general public 
        is not likely to be affected. </p>
        <br>
        <p><strong>AQI 151-200:</strong>Unhealthy</p>
        <p><strong>Air Quality:</strong> Everyone may begin to experience health effects, and members of sensitive groups 
        may experience more serious health effects.</p>
        <p><strong>Health Effects:</strong> More serious effects can occur, especially for those with pre-existing conditions.</p>
        <br>
        <p><strong>AQI 201-300:</strong>Very Unhealthy</p>
        <p><strong>Air Quality:</strong> Health Alert; everyone may experience more serious health effects</p>
        <p><strong>Health Effects:</strong> Increased respiratory effects and possibly more substantial health 
        warnings for the general public.</p>
        <br>
        <p><strong>AQI 301-500:</strong>Hazardous</p>
        <p><strong>Air Quality:</strong> Serious health effects for the entire population.</p>
        <p><strong>Health Effects:</strong> Health warnings of emergency conditions. The entire population is more likely 
        to be affected, and outdoor activities should be limited.</p>
