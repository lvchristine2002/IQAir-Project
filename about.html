            information globally using data from the IQAir API.</h3>

        <h3>Many people suffer from some kind of breathing complications, such as Asthma, and the air quality 
            affects their breathing more than others. This website hopes to provide reliable air quality information 
            in order to give these people the information they need in order to either prevent any complications due 
            to air quality or to allow people to plan their day accordingly. 
         </h3>

         <h3>It also includes temperature information that is useful for anybody looking
            for information about how the weather will be for that day, similar to the weather app for iPhone.
