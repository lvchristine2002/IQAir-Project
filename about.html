        <p>This project was developed to provide real-time air quality information globally using data from the IQAir API.</p>
        <br>
        <p>We want to spread awareness on the fact that pollution and bad air quality are becoming more prominent issues around the world. Our city pollution and healthcare monitoring tool can help users identify when the air quality is problematic around them and the necessary measures to avoid health related problems.</p>
